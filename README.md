# Library App

## Introduction
A REST-based library client using open-library API tested with Python 3.9. 
 
Our application uses external API from [open-library.org]() for developers which donâ€™t need key or any authentication. We have a simple user interface for our application so the information about books and users can be shown.  

Our app is developed in Python and Django framework.
REST-based service interface for CRUD
use sql_server.pyodbc to connect to the Azure database
Interaction with external API from open library
Use Microsoft Azure cloud database for persisting information.

The password of user account is encrpyted by hash and the Azure database is secured with role-based policies.

Our app is not serving in over https so you can run it on [http://127.0.0.1:8000]()
