## Installation
To use this api, first clone or download this repository into a folder. Next, install the modules listed in 'required modules.txt' and download and install the ODBC 17 Server Driver. Set up your database, we used Microsoft Azure but the default settings in 'default database.txt' will set up a local mysqlite database for easy use. To start the server navigate to the api's folder in a command prompt and type "py manage.py runserver".
